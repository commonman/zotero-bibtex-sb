This directory contains a set of changes proposed by me for Zotero's BibTeX
translator.  (As opposed to its parent directory which contains a more
heavily modified BibTeX translator which I am offering to users as a
suppliment to Zotero's BibTeX translator.

The BibTeX.js in this directory is from the Zotero development branch
and is the current one, as of its file Modification Time.  It is here
for convienience in creating patches and for comparison.  Browse the
current version here: 

https://www.zotero.org/trac/browser/extension/trunk/translators/BibTeX.js

And download the file here:

The proposed modifications are in:  BibTeX-proposed.js
