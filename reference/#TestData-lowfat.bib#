	abstract = {This essay investigates the narrative composition of the Gospel of Mark, especially those aspects of composition which make it a continuous, developing story and shape this story to influence the readers. The significance of these aspects of composition for the Gospel's presentation of Jesus Christ is emphasized. The importance of the commissions given to Jesus and the disciples is brought out, and the role relationships of Jesus to four significant groups are investigated. These relationships are developed in Mark through reiterative enrichment or through new, sometimes surprising developments. Attention is given to patterns of related scenes and to other compositional techniques which indicate emphasis and evaluation of characters and events. This includes study of the patterned use of paradox, irony, and enticement to false hope in connection with the passion announcements and passion story. There are suggestions as to the possible function of these compositional features in the author's communication with his readers.},

	annote = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}The} Song of Hannah (1 Sam 2:1-10) contains several key features that invite study from various perspectives. The project addresses these: the issue of the best available text, its dates of composition and of insertion into the book of Samuel, its genre and poetic features; and on a larger scale the Song\&apos;s interaction with its narrative context and the appearance of its archetypal \&quot;barren mother\&quot; imagery in Second Isaiah. Methodologically, the study applies text-critical principles to the various versions of the Song, and compares its linguistic and thematic features with those of archaic poems and Deuteronomistic passages in Joshua-2 Kings. It then analyzes form-critical aspects of the Song and examines its poetic features. Then the project applies typic and thematic approaches to the Song\&apos;s immediate and larger contexts: to the {birth-of-Samuel} account in 1 Sam 1:1-2:21, to 1 and 2 Samuel, and to Isaiah 40-55. The study concludes that the Song, a general hymn of praise, may well have been composed as early as the tenth century {B.C.E.,} and was inserted into the narrative toward the end of the monarchy by editors with priestly interests. The Song\&apos;s position early in the books of Samuel, and its theme of divine protection of the needy during times of transition, using \&quot;barren mother\&quot; imagery, celebrates the ultimate rule of the Deity in the lives of individuals and in affairs of state, and sets the theocratic tone for the incipient monarchy. In a later transitional time, Second Isaiah\&apos;s archetypal \&quot;barren mother\&quot; imagery celebrates the divine protection of Jerusalem on the verge of return to the Land at the end of the exile. These conclusions suggest that further study of later versions and appropriations of the Song, such as in Targum Jonathan, {Pseudo-Philo} and the Magnificat {(Luke} 1:46-55), would demonstrate the continuing significance of both theme and imagery.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}}
